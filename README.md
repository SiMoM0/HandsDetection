# Human hands detection and segmentation

Project for the course Computer Vision, UniPD 2022.

### Usage

#### Model

* Download the Hand Dataset ([link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/hands/)) and upload it on your Google Drive, in the main folder *MyDrive*.

* Open the Jupyter Notebook [handdetection.ipynb](https://github.com/SiMoM0/HandsDetection/blob/master/Model/handdetection.ipynb) on Google Colaboratory and connect your drive in order to run the code properly
